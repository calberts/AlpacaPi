<P>
The alpaca devices drivers are the "server" they sit and "listen" for a request exactly like a web server.

<P>
Each alpaca driver must listen on 2 ports, normally implemented in 2 different threads.
<P>



One thread is the "discovery" protocol which MUST listen on port 32227, this is simply a UDP connection listening for broadcast messages. When one request received, it reports back a very simple JSON packet that looks like

    {"alpacaport": 6800}

<P>


The number, 6800 in this case, is the TCP/IP port that the other thread is listening on.

<P>


The other thread listens on its own port (in this case 6800) for HTTP commands
<P>



On your client machine, you can then go to that IP address with a web browser as follows

    http://ipaddress:6800/setup

(refer to https://ascom-standa...Management API)
<P>



It also responds to Alpaca commands which look like this

http://192.168.1.89:6800/api/v1/telescope/0/interfaceversion



<P>



192.168.1.89 is the IP address of the alpaca server (device)

6800 is the port

api is the string telling the server it is an api command

v1 is the Alpaca version

telescope is the device type

0 is the device number (in case the driver is controlling more than one)

interfaceversion is the command


<P>



Refer to
https://ascom-standa...paca Device API





The Alpaca driver never initiates any communication. It is the "server"

Normal operation:

<OL>

<LI>Run a client program such as a camera controller.



<LI>This program, the client, would send out the discovery query via a broadcast to port 32227, it would then listen for responses. For each response, it would use the management interface to query what kind of device it is.
In this example, we are looking for cameras.



<LI>For each camera we find, open up a controller window to control THAT camera.
If no cameras are found, report the fact and exit.



<LI>Go back to my first post in this thread and you will see the windows in the first post.



<LI>The client then, on its own, periodically sends commands to the camera driver asking for information or sending a command.

For example, get camera type, specs etc and display to the user.
The user then clicks on TAKE PICTURE. The client sends the command to the driver/server to do that operation.



Note: EACH COMMAND is a HTTP get/put command, the TCP port is opened, the command is sent (using HTTP), the response is received and the connections is CLOSED.


All of the responses are JSON



<LI>The client polls the driver asking if its done, when it is, it asks for the picture data, gets the data and does what it wants with it. (i.e. save it).

Connecting ASCOM to ALPACA



ASCOM programs know NOTHING about Alpaca, this is where the ASCOM/Alpaca bridge comes in.
It runs on your Windows machine and it uses the discovery protocol to find Alpaca devices on the network.
It then allows you to create a "virtual" ASCOM device on your Windows machine that "translates" all of the ASCOM commands to Alpaca commands.

<P>

It is VERY IMPORTANT to note that there is a one-to-one translation.
That is the Alpaca commands are the EXACT same commands ASCOM already uses.
The ONLY difference is the method that the data is moved back and forth.
In normal ASCOM, this is done with the Windows COM interface.
With Alpaca, it is HTTP/JSON using what is called a RESTful interface. (I dont think the "RESTful" part is relevant, since I implement everything at the TCP/IP level).
