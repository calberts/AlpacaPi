SkyTravel is the part of the AlpacaPi suite of software. It allows full control of an Alpaca based
observatory. Specifically you can control the dome, cameras, focusers, telescope mount, switches,
all from the same program.  It does NOT REQUIRE that you use SkyTravel for all of these devices.
Additionally, due to the nature of Alpaca, you can have SkyTravel running on multiple computers at the same time.
Just be careful if you are trying to tell a device two different things at the same time.

<H3>AAVSO Target Tool</H3>
<A HREF=https://www.aavso.org/ TARGET=AAVSO">AAVSO</A> provides a list of
objects of interest via a system called "Target tool".

This list shows observations that professional astronomers would like assistance with in
the form of additional observations, many of which can be accomplished by amateur astronomers.
<P>
In order to use the target tool, you must create an account.
